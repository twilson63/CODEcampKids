The basic training consists of the ability to read and write cyber files and to create/remove cyber directories, to understand the deep meaning of the cyber academy document structure (HTML), the cadet will also learn how to create the very basics of their cyber profile by editing and copying and pasting text in their favorite electronic journal editor, the cadet will learn how to preview their profile using a ancient web browser, and they will learn how to teleport their coded documents to other places using cyber code repositories, lastly the will take their finished profile and teleport it to the public internet in a safe and secure location that they will only have to codes to access.

		  									<strong> Focus: </strong>The cadet will learn the intense styling of an intergalactic document, and while they are learning how to make their documents dazzle their fellow cadets; they will be applying these styles to their own cybernaut profile, so when they graduate the academy they will be able to submit their cybernaut profile to their team. The training consists of the ability to use these styles to product a cyber navigational system for their profile. The cadet will also learn how to create additional documents to enrich their cyber profile by creating document to describe their favorite items, pets and family members.
		  									<br><br>
		  									We want our cadets profile sites to look good on these different devices so a large part of our training will be learning how to make our cyber profiles look good on a mobile device as well as a desktop device without having to duplicate the content. In the last lesson we will tackle the art of cyber movement and we will teach our cadets how to make their profile move with our animation tools, this will empower them to take their cyber documents to the next level and bounce in to the foreground and bounce out to the background as their fellow cybernauts move through their profile site.

		  									<strong> Focus: </strong>The cadet will build their own journaling application to record and document their Intergalactic Missions. Building your own journal will provide you the skills to build other applications that help you accomplish many tasks in your missions, so this is by far one of the most important courses in your training. We want to build a journal platform that will enable you to easily document but at the same time generate a very rich and consumable report by the IGC or (InterGalactic Command).
		  									<br><br>
		  									In our profile, we will build a new location. This location will have a input form for us to capture our information and a list of report links that navigate to our fully detailed reports. We will learn how to setup a journal report storage facility, this facility will contain pure content of our report, in some regions of the Intergalactic Universe they refer to these systems as databases. We will learn how to capture content in a entry form and publish it into a database system, then we will learn how request all of the content back to us in another Intergalactic structured format (JSON), this will be second secret format that our cybernauts use to transmit information. Then, we will create a collection of rules that will instruct our profile system to display this content using the Intergalatic styling codes that we have created.
		  									<br><br>
		  									Lastly, we are going to create a new section in our navigational system called games, and we will be the first of many simple games you will build to entertain you and your fellow cadets through the long missions.

		  									<strong> Focus: </strong>The cadet will build their own robot rover that they can command to explore every corner of the universe. Building a cybernaut’s companion rover is a very special event!
		  									<br><br>
		  									The rover will go on so many missions and it is important to personalize the rover bot with very individual look. So mission control will provide plenty of decorating materials so that the cadet can make their rover unique. But we still have to assemble the rover bot from scratch and then create a brain for the bot so that we can transmit instructions from our devices to navigate the rover.
		  									<br><br>
		  									Cadets you will be writing groups of recipes or programs that enable you to press certain keys to navigate the rover bot forward, backward, turn left, and turn right. You will learn how to connect hardware and software, how servos/motors work and how to illuminate your rover bot.
		  									<br><br>
		  									In the training exercise, you will have to program your rover to navigate through an obstacle course and if successful without knocking down any of the obstructions you will have made it through the academy training.
		  									<br><br>
		  									<strong>Final Presentation</strong>
		  									The last lesson is the graduation ceremony, you will present to your sponsors and the Admiral a 3-minute presentation.  In this presentation, you will talk about what you learned and demo your Profile, Journal and Robot. You will receive your certificate and your cybernaut uniform (T-Shirt). You will get your picture taken with the Admiral of the Intergalactic Fleet and your Sponsors (Parents and Sponsor) – with your parents consent you will be posted on our hall of cybernauts on our mission control web portal (WebSite).

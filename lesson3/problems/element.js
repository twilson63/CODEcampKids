element or tag

The 'tag' is the instruction used by the browser to process your content.

How does a tag look?

A tag is wrapped around 'angle brackets': '<' and '>'

  <tag>

In order for the browser to know what content the tag would like to instruct, we
need a way to wrap or associate content with a particular tag.

Using the </tag> 'angle brackets with at slash we can indicate the end of a
tag, to create a block or closure.'

    <!-- start of block -->
    <tag>
      your content here
    </tag>
    <!-- end of block -->

By using this start and end pattern, the browser is able to understand that the
instruction is inside the angle brackets and the content is inside the block.

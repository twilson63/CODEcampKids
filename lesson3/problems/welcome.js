Welcome to Cadet Training Lesson 3

In this lesson we will start learning HTML, in lesson 2 we learned about text editors
and editing text. In lesson 1 we learned about the command-line and directories
and files. These two lessons are building blocks to get us to the point of creating
our first web page.

This lesson will focus on the web page language, HTML, or Hypertext Markup Language.

It is the language that Web Browser Applications understand to display content to
a user.

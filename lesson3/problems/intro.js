Introduction to HTML

HTML is a language that is used to organize content and convey it in a standard
format that web browser applications can understand and process.

Just like any language HTML has a set of semantics that must be followed in order
to be valid.

In the language there is instructions that inform the web browser your intent and
there is actual content or data that you want the browser application to display.

The instructions are called elements or tags, the word are used interchangably.

use to manipulate the presentation of the content.

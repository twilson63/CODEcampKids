Arrow Keys

When working with files, you need a way to navigate the file itself as you perform
edits and modifications. Most common editors use the arrow keys on the keyboard
to navigate through the file without performing any modification.

In 'atom', you can hold the

'cmd' (Mac) or 'ctrl' (Chromebook) keys and

move to the front or end of a line with the 'left' and 'right' arrow keys

move to the beginning or end of the file using the 'up' and 'down' arrow keys

In 'atom', you can hold the

'alt' key

and move left or right by word using the 'left' and 'right' arrow keys

Exercise:

Run the $ADVENTURE_COMMAND run command to generate a file called 'beepboop.html'

    $ADVENTURE_COMMAND run

In your text editor, use the open command to open the file and use the arrow keys
to move to every word that says ADVATAR in all caps and remove the ADVATAR word
and add your advatar name, then save the file and run the verify command.

    $ADVENTURE_COMMAND verify

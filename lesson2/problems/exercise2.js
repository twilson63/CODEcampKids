Create a origin story about your avatar.

In your story, answer the following questions:

* Where is your avatar from?
* Does the avatar have any special powers or skills?
* What was the most interesting event that happen when your avatar was little?
* Why does your avatar want to become the cyber explorer?

Then find 6 words that you would like to replace in a madlibs game, and list
them out by type:

NOUN, ADJECTIVE, VERB, NAME, SILLY WORD, etc.

Once completed, work with your teammate to fill out the list of words on a piece
of paper.

When you get the list of words, return to your editor and replace them in your
story. Then read.

What can I expect on Day 1?

* We will learn how to use the 'command-line'.
* We will learn how to use a text editor.
* We will learn how to code in html.
* We will learn how to use 'git' to store our code.

At the end of day 1, we should have a web site running on the internet.

What can I expect by the end of the course?

We will build a web site, run it in a mobile device, build a web application, and
create and program a rover robot! It will be 4 long days, and a lot of hard work.

Lets check and make sure you have everything setup on your system:

First we need to confirm you have a 'terminal' or 'console' application.

On the mac, click the 'search' icon next to the clock and type 'terminal' in the
spotlight search box.

Once the terminal appears, lets confirm you have 'npm' installed and todays lessons
installed.

    npm i cal0 -g
    npm i cal1 -g
    npm i cal2 -g
    npm i cal3 -g
    npm i cal4 -g
